# unscramble-cs-problems
Data structures and algorithm project using python

The project basically deconstructs a series of open-ended problems into smaller components which includes different tasks which are implementation part of each of the tasks with the help of algorithms such that each task should be analyzed to determine the worst case time complexity of Big O. The main idea of this project is not optimizing the code, but analysing the time complexity of these implemented algorithms.
